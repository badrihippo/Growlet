# Growlet

the librarian in your pocket [WORK IN PROGRESS]

## Installing

**WARNING:** This app is still work-in-progress, and the database is
subject to change. Feel free to test it out, but be aware that the app
data may suddenly get reset or cleared upon update.

Growlet is made using the [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org)
framework. Please refer to the [official docs](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup)
to set up your NativeScript build environment.

Once you have the environment set up, you can build and run this like
any other NativeScript app:

```
# Build it
tns build android

# Run it
tns run android
```

Currently, I'm only developing for the Android version—but feel free to
adapt it for iOS if you have the time.

## Built with

This app was built with the help of the following apps and services:

 * [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org) framework
 * [NativeScript Image Builder](http://nsimage.brosteins.com/) for
   generating the app icons and splash screens
 * [Material Icons](https://material.io/icons/) to use in the interface

...and several plugins from the NativeScript community.

## Contributing

This is my first app as well as my first NativeScript project. So I
don't have any special structure or style for contributions—just send
in your pull requests :)

Feedback on the code is also welcome. And if you're new to NativeScript
too, feel free to join in: we can work things out together.
